LAB_07-- PID DC Motor Controller
This lab exercise is to write a program performing the following tasks:
• Tracks motor speed through a quadrature encoder.
• Generates a variable duty-cycle PWM signal to drive the H-bridge.
• Uses a PI control loop to tune the duty-cycle to achieve the desired speed
